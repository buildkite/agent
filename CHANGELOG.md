### Security
- ⚠️ When using `artifact download`, artifacts that were uploaded with paths containing `..` will no longer be able to traverse up from the destination path. This change is unlikely to break the vast majority of pipelines, however if you are relying on `..` for path traversal and cannot fix your pipeline, you can enable the new experiment `allow-artifact-path-traversal` [#2815](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2815) (@DrJosh9000)
- Redact Job API token like other env vars [#2834](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2834) (@DrJosh9000)

> [!WARNING]
> This release has two potentially breaking changes in the way environment
> variables are interpolated.

* Interpolation on Windows should be done in a case-_in_sensitive manner to be
  compatible with Batch scripts and Powershell. This was working correctly up
  until some refactoring in v3.59.0.

  For example, this pipeline:

  ```yaml
  env:
    FOO: bar
  steps:
  - command: echo $Foo $FOO
  ```

  should now be correctly interpolated on Windows as:

  ```yaml
  env:
    FOO: bar
  steps:
  - command: echo bar bar
  ```

  Interpolation on other platforms is unchanged.

* Our [documented interpolation rules](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/environment-variables#environment-variable-precedence)
  implies that variables from the agent environment have higher precedence than
  variables defined by the job environment ("we merge in some of the variables
  from the agent environment").

  Suppose the agent environment contains `FOO=runtime_foo`. The pipeline

  ```yaml
  env:
    BAR: $FOO
    FOO: pipeline_foo
  steps:
  - command: echo hello world
  ```

  would in previous releases be interpolated as:

  ```yaml
  env:
    BAR: runtime_foo
    FOO: pipeline_foo
  steps:
  - command: echo hello world
  ```

  On the other hand, the pipeline

  ```yaml
  env:
    FOO: pipeline_foo
    BAR: $FOO
  steps:
  - command: echo hello world
  ```

  would be interpolated to become

  ```yaml
  env:
    FOO: pipeline_foo
    BAR: pipeline_foo
  steps:
  - command: echo hello world
  ```

  We think this is inconsistent with the agent environment taking precedence,
  and if users would like to interpolate `$FOO` as the value of the pipeline
  level definition of `FOO`, they should ensure the agent environment does not
  contain `FOO`.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/compare/v3.49.0...v3.50.0)

This release contains multiple issues:

|Severity|Description|Fixed in|
|---|---|---|
| Medium | When uploading pipelines, some group steps are not correctly parsed, and were ignored. | **✅ Fixed in [v3.50.1](#v3.50.1)** |
| Low | Uploading pipelines with empty or zero-length `steps` failed, where they should've been a no-op. | **✅ Fixed in [v3.50.1](#v3.50.1)** |
| ⚠️ Very High | Jobs running on this version of the agent are not cancellable from the UI/API | **✅ Fixed in [v3.50.2](#v3.50.2)** |
| Medium | When uploading pipelines, if any object in the pipeline YAML contained multiple merge keys, the pipeline would fail to parse. See below for a workaround | **✅ Fixed in [v3.50.3](#v3.50.3)** |


<details>
<summary>Workaround for yaml merge key issue</summary>
For example, this pipeline would fail to parse:

```yaml
default_plugins: &default_plugins
  plugins:
    - docker#4.0.0:
        image: alpine:3.14

default_retry: &default_retry
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: 42

steps:
  - <<: *default_plugins
    <<: *default_retry
    command: "echo 'hello, world!'"
```

As a workaround for this, you can use yaml array merge syntax instead:

```yaml
default_plugins: &default_plugins
  plugins:
    - docker#4.0.0:
        image: alpine:3.14

default_retry: &default_retry
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: 42

steps:
  - <<: [*default_plugins, *default_retry]
    command: "echo 'hello, world!'"
```
</details>

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/compare/v3.47.0...v3.48.0)

The de-experimentification release!

- The `ansi-timestamps` experiment is now enabled by default. To remove the
  timestamps from your logs, you can pass the `--no-ansi-timestamps` flag.
- The `flock-file-locks` experiment is now enabled by default. Because the old
  and new file lock systems don't interact, we *strongly* recommend not running
  multiple agents of different versions on the same host.
- The `inbuilt-status-page` experiment is now enabled by default. For those
  running the agent with `--health-check-addr`, go to `/status` to see a
  human-friendly status page.

And whatever happened to `git-mirrors`? It graduated from experiment-hood in
v3.47.0!

### Changed
- De-experimentify ansi-timestamps [#2133](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2133) (@DrJosh9000)

- De-experimentify inbuilt-status-page [#2126](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2126) (@DrJosh9000)

### Fixed

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/compare/v3.46.1...v3.47.0)

Two new and very noteworthy experiments!

1. Have you ever wanted to write hooks in a compiled language? Or in Python or
   Ruby? Well now you can! With `--experiment=polyglot-hooks` the agent can run
   all sorts of hooks and plugins directly. Combined with
   `--experiment=job-api`, your hooks-of-a-different-language can alter
    environment variables through the local Job API!
2. Concurrency groups are great, but have you ever wanted to manage multiple
   agents running on the same host concurrently accessing a shared resource?
   Well now you can! With `--experiment=agent-api`, the agent now has an inbuilt
   locking service, accessible through new `lock` subcommands and also via a
   Unix socket (like the `job-api`).

### Added
- Experiment: Polyglot hooks [#2040](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2040) (@moskyb)
- Experiment: Local Agent API, with locking service [#2042](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2042) (@DrJosh9000)

### Fixed
- The `normalised-upload-paths` experiment was unintentionally left out of the available experiments list [#2076](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2076) (@MatthewDolan)

### Changed
- The `git-mirrors` experiment is promoted to full functionality [#2032](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2032) (@moskyb)

## [3.45.0](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/tree/3.45.0) (2023-03-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/compare/v3.44.0...3.45.0)

It's a busy one! The major new feature in this release is the `job-api` experiment, which enables an HTTP API within the agent that allows jobs to inspect and mutate their environment, without using the normal bash-isms that we normally require. This is a big step towards supporting hooks and plugins in other languages, and we're really excited to see what you all do with it!

When this experiment is enabled, the agent will start an HTTP server on a unix domain socket, the address of which will be made available through the `BUILDKITE_AGENT_JOB_API_SOCKET` environment variable, with a token available through the `BUILDKITE_AGENT_JOB_API_TOKEN` environment variable. This socket can be used with the `buildkite-agent env {get,set,unset}` commands on the commandline, or directly through cURL or other HTTP client. Included in this release of the agent is a [golang client](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/blob/main/jobapi/client.go), which can be imported directly into your Go projects.

Also included is another experimental feature, `descending-spawn-priority`, which makes agents using the `--spawn-with-priority` flag spawn agents with a descending priority, rather than the default ascending priority. This is useful when running agents on heterogeneous hardware (ie, having two agents on one machine and four on another), as it means that jobs will be spread more evenly across the agents. For more information, see [the original issue](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/issues/1929), and [@DrJosh9000's PR](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/2004). Huge thanks to @nick-f for bringing this to our attention!

## 3.0-beta.19 - 2017-03-29

### Added

- `buildkite-agent start --disconnect-after-job` will run the agent, and automatically disconnect after running its first job. This has sometimes been referred to as "one shot" mode and is useful when you spin up an environment per-job and want the agent to automatically disconnect once it's finished its job
- `buildkite-agent start --disconnect-after-job-timeout` is the time in seconds the agent will wait for that first job to be assigned. The default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes). If a job isn't assigned to the agent after this time, it will automatically disconnect and the agent process will stop.

## [2.2] - 2016-09-21

### Added

- The buildkite-agent binary is now built with Golang 1.7 giving us support for macOS Sierra
- The agent now talks HTTP2 making calls to the Agent API that little bit faster

- meta-data-ec2 and meta-data-ec2-tags can now be configured using BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2 and BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2_TAGS environment variables

### Changed

- We've removed our dependency of libc for greater compatibly across \*nix systems which has had a few side effects:
  We've had to remove support for changing the process title when an agent starts running a job. This feature has only ever been available to users running 64-bit ubuntu, and required us to have a dependency on libc. We'd like to bring this feature back in the future in a way that doesn't have us relying on libc
- The agent will now use Golangs internal DNS resolver instead of the one on your system. This probably won't effect you in any real way, unless you've setup some funky DNS settings for agent.buildkite.com
