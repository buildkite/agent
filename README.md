# Buildkite Agent ![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/08e4e12a0a1e478f0994eb1e8d51822c5c74d395.svg?branch=master)

_Note: This is the development branch of the buildkite-agent, and may not contain files or code in the current stable release._

The buildkite-agent is a small, reliable, and cross-platform build runner that makes it easy to run automated builds on your own infrastructure. It’s main responsibilities are polling [buildkite.com](https://buildkite.com/) for work, running build jobs, reporting back the status code and output log of the job, and uploading the job's artifacts.

Full documentation is available at [buildkite.com/docs/agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent)

```

## Dependencies

The agent is fairly portable and should run out of the box on most supported platforms without extras. On Linux hosts it requires `dbus`.

## Installing

[The agents page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/agents) on Buildkite has personalised instructions, or you can refer to [the Buildkite docs](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/installation). Both cover installing the agent with Ubuntu (via apt), Debian (via apt), macOS (via homebrew), Windows and Linux.

You can also run the agent [via Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildkite/agent).

## Starting

To start an agent all you need is your agent token, which you can find on your Agents page within Buildkite.

```bash
buildkite-agent start --token
```

## Development

These instructions assume you are running a recent macOS, but could easily be adapted to Linux and Windows.

```bash
# Make sure you have go 1.11+ installed.
brew install go

# Download the code somewhere, no GOPATH required
git clone https://github.com/buildkite/agent.git
cd agent

# Create a temporary builds directory
mkdir /tmp/buildkite-builds

# Build an agent binary and start the agent
go build -i -o /usr/local/bin/buildkite-agent .
buildkite-agent start --debug --build-path=/tmp/buildkite-builds --token "abc"

# Or, run the agent directly and skip the build step
go run *.go start --debug --build-path=/tmp/buildkite-builds --token "abc"
```

### Dependency management

We're using Go 1.14+ and [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage our Go dependencies.

If you are using Go 1.11+ and have the agent in your `GOPATH`, you will need to enable modules via the environment variable:

```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Dependencies are no longer committed to the repository, so compiling on Go <= 1.10 is not supported.
